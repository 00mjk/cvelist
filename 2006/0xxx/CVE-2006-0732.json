Details will be updated after the grace period has ended. NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration Server. webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however, both are discouraged in the documentation. In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative privileges through other means."
