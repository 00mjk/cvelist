An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could trick a user by redirecting the user to a specially crafted website. The specially crafted website could either spoof content or serve as a pivot the chain an attach with other vulnerabilities in web services.To exploit the vulnerability, the user must click a specially crafted URL.In an application-based attack scenario, an attacker could manipulate specific parameters and create a specially crafted URL in attempt to convince the user to click it.In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to appear as a legitimate website to the user. However, the attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the specially crafted website. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the specially crafted website, typically by way of enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince the user to interact with content on the website.The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft SharePoint handles URL redirects."
