A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the \"redirect_uri\" parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code.\n\nThis vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements:\n\n    Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. @EnableAuthorizationServer)\n    Uses the DefaultRedirectResolver in the AuthorizationEndpoint\n\nThis vulnerability does not expose applications that:\n\n    Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different RedirectResolver implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver\n    Act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer)\n    Act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient)"}]},"problemtype":{"problemtype_data":[{"description":[{"lang":"eng","value":"CWE-601: Open Redirect"}]}]},"references":{"reference_data":[{"refsource":"CONFIRM","url":"https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3778"}]},"impact":null}
