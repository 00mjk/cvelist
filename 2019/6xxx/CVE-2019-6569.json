X408 and SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V4.1.3), SCALANCE XP/XC/XF-200 switch family (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (All versions < V4.1). The monitor barrier of the affected products insufficiently blocks data from being\nforwarded over the mirror port into the mirrored network. An attacker might use\nthis behaviour to transmit malicious packets to systems in the mirrored network, \npossibly influencing their configuration and runtime behaviour. \n\nThe security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network\naccess to the traffic-receiving network. Successful exploitation requires no system\nprivileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability\nto compromise the confidentiality and availability of the traffic-generating network.\n\nAt the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security\nvulnerability was known.\n"
