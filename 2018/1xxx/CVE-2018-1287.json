This could allow an attacker to get Access to JMeterEngine and send unauthorized code. This only affect tests running in Distributed mode. Mitigation: * Users must use last version of Java 8 or Java 9 * Users must upgrade to last JMeter 4.0 version Besides, we remind users that in distributed mode, JMeter makes an Architectural assumption that it is operating on a 'safe' network. i.e. everyone with access to the network is considered trusted. This typically means a dedicated VPN or similar is being used. Example: * Start JMeter server using either jmeter-server or jmeter -s * If JMeter listens on *:1099, you are vulnerable Credit: This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat Security Team by Brenden Meeder.
