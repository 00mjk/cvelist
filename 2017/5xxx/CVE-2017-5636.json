Mitigation: A fix has been provided (modification of the tokenization code and sanitization of user-provided input). This fix was applied in NIFI-3487 and released in Apache NiFi 0.7.2 and 1.1.2. 1.x users running a clustered environment should upgrade to 1.1.2. 0.x users running a clustered environment should upgrade to 0.7.2. Additional migration guidance can be found here -- https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Migration+Guidance. Credit: This issue was discovered by Andy LoPresto."
