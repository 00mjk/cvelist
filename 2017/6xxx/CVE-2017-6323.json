This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts. XML external entity (XXE) attacks may allow disclosure of local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data. The attack uses file URI schemes or relative paths in the system identifier to access files that should not normally be accessible. Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(S) requests or launching a CSRF attack to any unprotected internal services."
