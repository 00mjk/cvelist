This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only. The original issue (CVE-2015-3148) was described as: It was discovered that libcurl could incorrectly reuse Negotiate authenticated HTTP connections for subsequent requests. If an application using libcurl established a Negotiate authenticated HTTP connection to a server and sent subsequent requests with different credentials, the connection could be re-used with the initial set of credentials instead of using the new ones."
