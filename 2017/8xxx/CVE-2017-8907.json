An attacker who can login to Bamboo as a user without the edit permission for deployment projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an existing plan with a green build, to create a deployment project and execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent. By default a local agent is enabled; this means that code execution can occur on the system hosting Bamboo as the user running Bamboo."
