The line card will reboot and recover without user interaction. However, additional specifically malformed packets may cause follow-on line card resets and lead to an extended service outage. This issue only affects E Series routers with IPv6 licensed and enabled. Routers not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue."
